# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Welcome to Donkey Betz thanks to Farza for pointing me on a path to build the dumbest thing I could think of and am starting a blog about

This will be a full stack dapp of everything I learned about this year will touch on lottery, go fund-me, staking, defi and keepers

will need:
chainlink, openzeppelin, Alchemy, ipfs(nfts for art work for each game), etherscan, etc.

Start with article covering AH HA moment and go over steven grinders udemy course
build into what we are going to be building just because its so stupid that its fun
give credit and lay out path to follow from erc20, lottery, staking, defi, etc.
plans on writing releases and applying for jobs while trying to break into the space over 40
get a 100 followers ill start making youtube videos and kind just talking about what its like right now doing this start over

plans on making youtube videos if

buy in with erc20
single person 3 number lottery
they pay an entrance fee and pick 3 numbers
get random number will call 3 digit random number
if numbers match it pays out 2 to 1 on the bet
burn erc20 to for payouts

staking dapp that feeds the lottery contract
update website with new contracts to add games to evolve into a casino
use nft art for the games, paying the nft holder a percentage of the games pay out

depositing funds calls fund lottery functions
funds are held in a defi contract until it pays out a bet or a predetermined time has been met
lottery is a 3 digit match payouts TBD
keepers will update the contracts weekly paying out profits from stakes
